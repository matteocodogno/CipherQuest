Abstract
The integration of autonomous systems in healthcare represents a transformative frontier in medical practice, promising unprecedented efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility.
From AI-powered diagnostics to robotic-assisted surgeries, these technologies have the potential to revolutionize patient care.
However, with such progress comes a host of ethical challenges. This thesis explores the delicate balance between fostering innovation and maintaining responsibility in deploying autonomous healthcare systems. It delves into key issues such as patient autonomy, informed consent, algorithmic bias, and the moral responsibilities of developers and practitioners. By examining case studies and ethical frameworks, this work aims to provide actionable guidelines for designing and implementing autonomous systems that prioritize patient well-being and uphold ethical integrity.
