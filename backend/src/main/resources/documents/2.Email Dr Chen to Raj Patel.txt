Subject: In Case of Emergency

Dear Raj,
If you are reading this, then I am no longer able to communicate directly, and the world is facing
a dire situation. I trust you, Raj, to understand the gravity of what I am about to share and to act
with the utmost discretion.
In the design of the Overmind, we always foresaw the potential for misuse or overreach. As
such, a contingency plan was embedded within its core—a Dead Man Switch that could
deactivate the AI if necessary. This failsafe was designed with layers of complexity to ensure it
would only be used in the most extreme circumstances.
The key to this Dead Man Switch is not straightforward. It is a composite of significant moments
and milestones from my life, encoded into an alphanumeric sequence. Here are the clues you
need to piece together the code:
1. The Day I First Saw the Stars: The date I was born. It's a day that set the stage for my
lifelong journey.
2. The Dawn of Insight: The ID number of my very first research paper on AI ethics,
published when the world was just beginning to grasp the potential of artificial
intelligence.
3. The Triumph of Achievement: The day I earned my PhD, a significant milestone that
propelled me into the world of advanced research and development.
4. The Birth of Overmind: The exact date when Overmind was activated, a momentous
occasion that marked a new era for humanity.
Each of these clues holds a piece of the code. When combined correctly, they form the key to
initiate the Dead Man Switch. Remember, this action is irreversible and should only be executed
if Overmind has unequivocally become a threat to humanity's existence.
The final alphanumeric code is a concatenation of these elements, separated by hyphens for
readability. Each element is composed of 8 characters. The dates are formatted as ddMMyyyy.
For example:
25012150-03422719-21420719-21350001

I have always believed in the resilience and wisdom of the human spirit. If it has come to this,
trust your instincts and the clues I have provided.
Stay vigilant, Raj. The future may depend on your resolve.
With hope and trust,
Elara
