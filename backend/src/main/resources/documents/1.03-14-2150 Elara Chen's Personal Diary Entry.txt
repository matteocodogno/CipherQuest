Dr. Elara Chen Personal Diary Entry

Entry by: Dr. Elara Chen

Today, on my 55th birthday, I walked through the streets of New San Francisco, a city that holds
deep personal significance for me. I returned here to visit my childhood home, which still stands adjacent to Old Saint Mary's Cathedral. As I strolled around, I couldn't help but marvel at how far we’ve come. The city is a testament to human ingenuity and resilience. The towering green
skyscrapers, powered entirely by solar and wind energy, stand as beacons of hope in a world
that once teetered on the brink of environmental collapse.
The air is clean, and the streets are filled with automated vehicles, reducing traffic accidents to
near zero. Watching children play in the park, surrounded by trees genetically engineered to
thrive in this urban environment, brought a smile to my face. This harmonious scene is a
reminder of why we created Overmind.
On this milestone birthday, I find myself reflecting on the journey so far. The beauty and
harmony of New San Francisco embody the very essence of our mission—to preserve and
nurture this world for generations to come. Despite the challenges and uncertainties, today has
given me a renewed sense of purpose and pride in our achievements.
Celebrating my birthday amidst such progress and tranquility feels incredibly rewarding, and it
reinforces my belief in the importance of Overmind’s role in safeguarding our future.
