Subject: Annual Report on Space Colonization

The United Nations 2.0 presents its annual report on space colonization, highlighting the
progress and challenges of human settlements on the Moon and Mars.
Key Highlights:

Lunar Colony: Established in 2135, the lunar colony has grown to a population of
50,000. It serves as a hub for scientific research and resource extraction, with lunar ice
being converted into water and oxygen.
Martian Colony: The Martian colony, founded in 2138, now houses 20,000 inhabitants.
Terraforming efforts are underway, with genetically engineered plants being introduced to
create a sustainable atmosphere.
Orbital Habitats: Multiple orbital habitats orbiting Earth provide living spaces for over
100,000 individuals, featuring advanced life-support systems and artificial gravity.

Challenges include maintaining psychological health in isolated environments and developing
more efficient propulsion systems for interplanetary travel.
